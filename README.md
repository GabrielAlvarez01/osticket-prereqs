For the first step, we are going to log in to Microsoft Azure. In case this is the first time for you using Azure, you will need to create or use a Microsoft account. Also is important to mention that creating a virtual machine will require a credit card, but don¬¥t worry, the charges for use are not expensive, and even if you are unable to pay, you have a bonus budget of $200 for 30 days if this is your first time. 

Search and click on the virtual machine on your Azure dashboard, and select "Create a virtual machine" on the first tab, provide a name to your VM (virtual machine) that will also create a research group (where you can manage your cloud resources like virtual machines), I recommend to use the version of  "Windows 10 Pro, version 22H2 - x64 Gen2 with a size of Standard_D2ads_v6 - 2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory" witch was the one I used, set a username and a password, accept the terms of use and skip the rest of tabs until you get to review+create.

Now that your VM is created, it's time to access it by using remote desktop access. You can find this option in your Windows search bar; it will request an IP. This IP can be found if you go back to the virtual machines, and on your virtual machine, scroll sideways to the public IP address. After introducing your IP address, log in using the username and password you used to create a VM, and uncheck all the switches.
